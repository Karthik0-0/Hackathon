        The Lodh Falls (also known as Budha Ghagh) is a waterfall in a mid forest of Palamau Tiger Reserve, South division of Latehar district in Jharkhand state in India. It is the highest waterfall in Jharkhand and the 21st highest waterfall in India.[1]
    <br><br>   It is located on the Burha River, deep in the forest of the Latehar district the Chota Nagpur Plateau.[2] The Lodh Falls is a tiered waterfall with multiple distinct drops in a relatively close succession. It is 143 metres (469 ft) high.[3] The thundering sound of the fall is audible even 10 km away.[4]

    The Lodh Falls is an example of a nick point caused by rejuvenation. Knick point, also called a nick point or simply nick, represents breaks in slopes in the longitudinal profile of a river caused by rejuvenation. The break in channel gradient allows water to fall vertically giving rise to a waterfall.[5]
